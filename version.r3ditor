R3ditor final update
<center>Sadly, this is the last update for R3ditor. (Too bad :/)<br> For now, this tool will be called "R3ditor OG", because we are creating a new version, with the right approach to do what we wanted to create. That being said, I do present R3ditor V2! It's a new tool to create mods and edit all RE3 files in a better way. It can edit more RDT Sections, Messages and more!<br><br>Check this <a target="_blank" href="http//themitosan.github.io/">link</a> to know more about.</center>
